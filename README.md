# puzzles-site

## Motivation
Most of the time when I have an appointment with a dentist, I see that
the puzzles in the newspapers or magazines are usually solved, leaving me with nothing else to do.
This repo exists to rectify this situation.
All I have to do now is point my browser to my static server, copy over the puzzles from the newspaper or the magazine and enjoy.

I plan to implement other logic puzzles such as sudoku, killer sudoku etc over time.

My ui/ux skills need a lot of improvement.
please feel free to send me PRs to make this app usable.
I would also be happy to receive PRs to include other logic puzzles

Currently this repo contains the following logic puzzles
