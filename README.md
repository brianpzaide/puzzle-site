# puzzles-site

## Motivation
Most of the time when I have an appointment with a dentist, I see that
the puzzles in the newspapers or magazines are usually solved, leaving me with nothing else to do.
This repo exists to solve this problem.
All I have to do now is point my browser to my static server, copy over the puzzles from the newspaper or the magazine and enjoy solving.

I plan to implement other logic puzzles such as sudoku, killer sudoku etc over time.

Todo
* improve the ui/ux and quality of this repo.
* Add more logic puzzles
* Add tests

I would be happy to receive PRs for adding new puzzles or improving the quality etc.

Currently this repo contains the following logic puzzles
* kenken
